    summary: 'Vivo launched its new series “VIVO NEX” and a unique selling point will no doubt be its revolutionary dual display screen. We decided to use this as our main focus and worked with our agency partner, Freeman and a digital artist to create a “Magic Mirror” interactive. Furthermore, we designed a special photo filter effects application and a digital artwork installation.',

            <p>The experience flow of guests begins as soon as they walk in front of the mirror. A beam of light will then cast above them and a message will appear in the mirror. These messages serve as reminders for guests to embrace and love themselves.</p>
            <p>For the 3 days event in 2 cities, we had more than 1000 guests who attended and interacted with our digital art installation.</p>
