            <p>For this event, we created an immersive experience which uses projection mapping combined with interactive LED lighting display. So how is it interactive? These LED lightings follow the beats of the music which will intensify the setting and set the mood.In addition, we have also incorporated DMX controllers to create visual effects throughout the show.</p>
            <p>Valued guests are issued with a RF-controlled LED wristband which will light up during the performance. Apart from that, guests will also get to see their name appear on the screen when the show begins and this is programmed with the data we gathered.</p>
            <p>We had a total of 700+ attendees over the 2 days of the event and received positive feedbacks from valued guests and client on the overall experience.</p>
