            <h2>Our Involvement</h2>
            <p>We created an interactive wall which was the highlight of the Pop-Up activation. The interactive wall consists of 10 different animations whereby when guests touch respective areas, content animation will be activated. An example will be when guests touch the lanterns, all lanterns on the wall will light up animate. In addition, it will also be accompanied by background music.</p>
            <p>Another segment of the event we facilitated is the Photo Booth. What’s different is that we incorporated green screen into an average photo booth and this will allow guests to take their miniaturize self thereby appearing on the interactive wall.</p>
            <p>Throughout this event, our data revealed that we gathered more than 20,000 hit rates on our interactive wall and 1000+ social posts of photos taken at our photo booth.</p>
