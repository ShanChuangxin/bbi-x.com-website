            <p>Just like how every detail of their jewellery deserves to be noticed, our role in this 11 Days event was to capture guests' precious moments and make them timeless. We caught glimpses of invaluable moments with a photobooth. At the photo booth, guests were free to express themselves and we captured 4 shots as soon as the guests were ready. </p>
            <p>After doing so, guests were able to choose their “best” shot on the screen . After selecting, guests were prompted to scan a QR code which led guests to the Chanel Official WeChat account. Guests simply had to follow the account thereby receiving the digital and physical copy.</p>
